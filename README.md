## Function and Purpose

The Ulam Spiral is a graphical depiction of a set of prime numbers with funky characteristics. Through this webpage, you can input different numbers, *n*, and check out
what the ulam spiral would look like up to that number. Reset the canvas with the reset button. Visualize with the visualize button after inputting a value. I also 
included some info on the spiral and its relevance to number theory conjectures, so read it if you would like.

I initially created this as I myself am interested in the study of prime numbers. Their existence is that of an enigma, and I hope that they live up to my expectations when we, hopefully, discover their implications in our universe.
